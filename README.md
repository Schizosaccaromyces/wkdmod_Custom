# wkdmod is a fork of DevilutionX
## wkdmod aims to implement more quality of life changes that are deemed out of scope for DevX.  This modified version of DevilutionX focuses on a more modern and casual approach to ARPG gameplay and mechanics.

wkdmod is compatible with standard DevilutionX characters. Simply copy your character data and stash data into the **devxmods/wkdmod folder in %appdata%/roaming/**

wkdmod is compatible with Diablo & Hellfire game modes within DevilutionX.

### **DevX Master** with additional **NEW** features:

**[GLOBAL]**
- When Diablo is killed the game does not end and he drops loot (drops 5 items).
- Buffed loot drop chances 300% in Hell, 200% in Nightmare, Normal is unchanged.
- When killing Diablo, Nakrul, Hork Demon or Defiler loot drop tiers are determined by difficulty.  Best drops from these bosses will be found on Hell difficulty.
- Items are no longer destroyed at 0 durability, they become disabled and you must repair.
- Players do not drop items on death, unless you enable **INVADER** mode, more details below.
- Shared XP in multiplayer games.
- Black Deaths no longer permanently damage your character, HOWEVER, they have been given the same LIFESTEAL mechanic as the Skeleton King.
- Warrior, Barbarian, and Bard have all received a melee and ranged ToHit buff and are no longer desperate for Dexterity/ToHit gear.
- Golem has been buffed significantly and can no longer take Friendly Fire damage.
- Rogue gains +100 on Normal, +500 on Nightmare, or +1000 on Hell experience points when disarming a trap
- Nerfed Apocalypse in Diablo so it acts like its Hellfire counterpart
- When Full Quests in Multiplayer is enabled, Unique Quest items originally exclusive to Single Player can now drop.
- Swapped some scrolls out for the four oils I added in Hellfire, nobody will miss them

**Splash damage now does damage to two extra tiles** (so its more like a U instead of a T, the shape of the splash), and can be accessed with the following classes/weapons (and thanks to DevX is applied in both Diablo and Hellfire gamemodes):
- **Monk:** Staff, 2H Sword
- **Warrior:** 2H Sword, 1H Sword + Shield, 1H Mace + Shield (must have Shield equipped for splash to work with 1H)
- **Barbarian:** 2H Sword, 2H Axe, Staff, 2H Mace
- **Bard:** 2x 1H Sword, 2x 1H Mace, or 1H Sword + 1H Mace
- **Sorcerer:** Staff
- **WEAPONS EXPERT** (unlocked at Lvl 40) All classes gain access to splash damage on all melee weapons and barehanded.

**[HELLFIRE ONLY]**
- The following oils can now drop in singleplayer and multiplayer: Oil of Imperviousness, Oil of Death, Oil of Skill, *Oil of Permanence
*Very low chances of dropping from Hell Diablo and Hell Nakrul, and a set 10% chance to drop from Hell Nakrul specifically
- Buffed Nakrul drops slightly (drops 7 items) and Hell Nakrul now has a 10% chance to drop an Oil of Permanence.
- Buffed Defiler Drops (drops 4 items)
- Buffed Monk's Light Armor and Medium Armor passive bonuses significantly
- Buffed Monk's abilities with barehanded and 2H Sword
- Monk now has Infravision as a class skill
- Search Books and Search Scrolls no longer drop
- Barbarian no longer takes damage from the Rage skill, it will drain mana instead if the Barbarian has any
- Buffed Barbarian's passive bonuses with Axes, Staffs, 2H Swords, Bows
- Buffed Bard's passive bonuses with dual wielding any combination of 1H weapons, and Bows
- Hork Demon amulet drop is now a higher item level depending on difficulty (Normal: ilvl 15, Nightmare: ilvl 20, Hell: ilvl 30) and he drops more or less items depending on difficulty.
- Hellfire spell blocking has been completely removed.
- Hork Spawn now drop items like normal monsters.
- Hell Diablo will drop a book of Nova when killed.
- Fixed Hellfire Arrow behavior to be like Diablo

**[INVADER]**
- INVADER is a stand alone game mode within wkdmod.  It's just your standard wkdmod Diablo or Hellfire... but with a twist...
- If you toggle Friendly Fire ON within wkdmod, you will no longer have access to your normal characters and stash.  Instead, you will have access to your INVADER characters and stash.  
- INVADER characters and stash ARE NOT MEANT TO BE BACKED UP.  This is not enforceable, but if you play this mode and back up your files you are a wussy... especially because I already give you the chance to play with FF off and not lose your shit!
- INVADER characters are meant to be played in public games, and are encouraged to kill each other and take each others items.

**RECOMMENDED GAME SETTINGS FOR WKDMOD**
- <a href="https://github.com/wkdgmr/wkdmod/blob/5d408772fc32f20652193196221e57e9a8e1692b/diablo.ini" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DOWNLOAD PRECONFIGURED SETTINGS FILE</a> place this file into the **devxmods/wkdmod folder in %appdata%/roaming/** (or whatever location the game data is located depending on device you are playing on)
- Multiplayer (Select Loopback to play solo offline)
- SP QUESTS IN MP On* but only while playing in Normal.  Turn off for NM and Hell.
- Crippling Shrines OFF
- (Hellfire) Theo OFF* optional, I prefer it off.
- (Hellfire) Cow Quest can be turned on if you want to score some backstage tickets to Aerosmith at the coliseum and get an OP mid-game chest armor
- Friendly Fire OFF* Friendly Fire ON now enables INVADER game mode.  You will drop items upon death at the hands of monsters and players.
- **DEVIATE FROM THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AT YOUR PERIL**
- Please feel free to change any setting not mentioned here to your preference.

# What is DevilutionX

DevilutionX is a port of Diablo and Hellfire that strives to make it simple to run the game while providing engine improvements, bugfixes, and some optional quality of life features.

Check out the [manual](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki) for what features are available and how best to take advantage of them.

For a full list of changes see our [changelog](docs/CHANGELOG.md).

# How to Install

Note: You'll need access to the data from the original game. If you don't have an original CD then you can [buy Diablo from GoG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/diablo). Alternately you can use `spawn.mpq` from the [shareware](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionx-assets/releases/download/v2/spawn.mpq) [[2]](http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/demos/diablosw.exe) version, in place of `DIABDAT.MPQ`, to play the shareware portion of the game.

Download the latest [DevilutionX release](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/releases/latest) and extract the contents to a location of your choosing or [build from source](#building-from-source).

- Copy `DIABDAT.MPQ` from the CD or GOG-installation (or [extract it from the GoG installer](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki/Extracting-the-.MPQs-from-the-GoG-installer)) to the DevilutionX folder.
- To run the Diablo: Hellfire expansion you will need to also copy `hellfire.mpq`, `hfmonk.mpq`, `hfmusic.mpq`, `hfvoice.mpq`.

For more detailed instructions: [Installation Instructions](./docs/installing.md).
